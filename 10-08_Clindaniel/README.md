</h2>
<br>
**Summary:** Inka khipus were unique pre-Columbian, Andean semiotic technologies that used three-dimensional signs -- primarily knots, cords, and colors -- to record everything from accounting records to historical narratives. While numerical Inka khipu signs have been deciphered since the 1920s, scholars still have not deciphered any non-numerical Inka khipu signs, nor have they empirically demonstrated how such signs would have worked -- whether as the signs of a phonetic writing system, or something else entirely. Over the course of this talk, I demonstrate how combining careful archaeological excavation with big-picture computational analysis can help scholars break through this empirical impasse and address how the khipu system as a whole worked, as well as what its signs mean.

**Jon Clindaniel** is an Assistant Instructional Professor in the Masters in Computational Social Science program and a computational anthropologist, focused on solving difficult archaeological problems using data science techniques. Jon's research centers around applying data science techniques to solve difficult anthropological/archaeological problems and he is passionate about teaching these methodologies to students.
